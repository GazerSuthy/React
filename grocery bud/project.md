### learned how to use forms! :D

# key prop must be unique, array indexs are not to be used especially if we are going to change the array, would produce bugs. Traditional way is to use API to generate a custom key for each item

# in the function that handles the submit e.preventDefault() prevents refresh every time a form is submitted, this will not be needed when react is connected to a data base
