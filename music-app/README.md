Lessons learned 😊 (There are levels to this shit!) :
 - ** Take time to properly structure you app into a "react-tree" (https://reactjs.org/docs/thinking-in-react.html) [It will save time in the long run 😃] **
  - only use useContext for truely global variables, it can get messy as you have to file hop to figure out the flow of logic (since all your functions are in the context)
  - can be a nightmare to debug because you don't know what functions are related to which components because they are all in one place 🤯
  - Learn how to use git to save your work, I lost a week of progression by not saving my files ("oppurtunity in disguise because it allowed me to restructure code")
  
  ### Focus on ONE thing at a time!, Attention on what you are doing, Attention on Attention (Dandapani and Eckart) ###
    - I was trying to mix functionality (state management) and design (UI) which was confusing. Learned to Focus on UI first and then implentment functionality
      and it became more simple! 😁
